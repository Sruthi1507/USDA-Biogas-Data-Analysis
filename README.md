**Project Title: USDA Biogas Data Analysis Dashboard**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing biogas production data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The goal is to uncover patterns and insights into renewable energy generation across different states, years, and facility types. The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive way to explore metrics such as biogas output, feedstock utilization, and regional distribution, supporting data-driven decision-making for sustainable energy initiatives.
